## It's a MAD world! Contract Testing can help!

### Abstract:
APIs as products and microservices as a design pattern have become our day-to-day reality.

With more moving parts comes more complexity and a greater need for understanding. Developers and Product Managers need early warning signs that deployment is a bad idea.

Enter contract testing. (No, not the [contract negotiation mentioned in the Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/)...)

Provider teams building API products collaborate with the consumer teams who are their customers to determine information needs. This negotiation works out in various ways that result in interface agreements between the teams. This interface contract can be both automatically generated and automatically evaluated over time to better inform feature release decisions.

Join [Claire](http://aclairefication.com/) for an interactive exploration of contract testing as a feedback technique. Enable greater focus on the [individuals and interactions](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). Make responding to the changes of this MAD world easier!

### Learning Outcomes:
- Relate familiar communication patterns to this new technology practice
- Identify the problem that contract testing addresses
- Understand different kinds of contract testing
- Discuss different implementations of solutions
- See a demo in code
- Be able to explain the value of the practice on the first day back at the office
- Deploy API products more easily!
